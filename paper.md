#Introduction
We present aircraft measurements of BB0A over West Africa.

Particle size was measured using a PCASP (Bloggs et al 2004).

Jones et al (1998) conducted several studies in this region,  but continental-scale measurements have not previously been made.

A large uncertainty in modelling BBOA is the extent to which measurements in the literature can be applied at a regional scale.


#Simulations
We simulate the evolution of particle sizes as they are transported away from the source region.


Data shows significant increase in particle size.

#Methodology
We compared our measurements of particle size aging with a model simulation. The model is detailed in Smith et al 2002. 

#Results
Simulations indicate that co-agulation is the dominant growth mechanism for these particles.
